# Grippy – Ultracompact One-Handed “Grippy” Keyboard

![Grippy Assembled](images/grippy-asm.jpeg)

## Overview

Grippy started as a one-handed pocket keyboard. It uses chords to enter letters, numbers, and symbols. It quickly evolved into an everyday-carry note-taking pocket comptuer. 

I’ve gone through five complete hardware re-designs to achieve a low-profile ultralight EDC.
